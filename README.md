# Voltage-Programming-Scheme-for-AMOLED-Display-Using-Oxide-TFTs

## Abstract
This repository proposes a novel pixel architecture for Active Matrix Organic Light Emitting Diode displays, aimed at reducing settling and programming times to meet the demands of Ultra-High Definition (UHD) displays. By utilizing a voltage programming scheme and reducing the number of Thin Film Transistors (TFTs) used, the proposed design overcomes the limitations of traditional circuits, such as low aperture ratio, threshold voltage variation, and mobility degradation in oxide TFTs. Simulations of the proposed circuit demonstrate improved performance in aperture ratio and luminance uniformity.
